Change Log
==========

All library changes, in descending order.


Version 0.2.3

- Fixing a bug in which on the registration page, if you incorrectly filled out
  the registration form, all previous field values would be wiped.


Version 0.2.2
-------------

Version 0.2.0
-------------

**Released on July 28, 2014.**

- Fixing bug with CSRF.  In previous releases, this library included CSRF
  protection on *every* page of a user's site -- even if they didn't want it.
  In this release, we're now *only* including CSRF on the page that this library
  generates.  This is less confusing for users.

  REST API with Stormpath!
