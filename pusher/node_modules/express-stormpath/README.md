# stormpath-express

Build simple, secure web applications with Stormpath and Express!


**NOTE**: This library is an early release.  It's currently lacking many
features, and only handles basic use cases.  We're working on adding lots of
cool stuff to the library which will improve it's general usefulness.  If you
have feedback, please get in touch and share your thoughts!
